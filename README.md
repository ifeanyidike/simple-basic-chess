### Simple Chess Game

This chess game just allows users to move pieces to valid/legal squares in the board.
There're no checks, checkmates, en passant or castling.

The chess game is created from scratch with no chess libraries. It would be easier to implement these functionalities with a chess library such as chess.js.
